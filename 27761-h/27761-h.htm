<h4><a name="preface" id="preface">PREFACE.</a></h4>

<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> play of <i>Hamlet</i> is above all others the most
stupendous monument of Shakespeare's genius,
standing as a beacon to command the wonder and
admiration of the world, and as a memorial to future
generations, that the mind of its author was moved by
little less than inspiration. <i>Lear</i>, with its sublime
picture of human misery;&mdash;<i>Othello</i>, with its harrowing
overthrow of a nature great and amiable;&mdash;<i>Macbeth</i>,
with its fearful murder of a monarch,
whose "virtues plead like angels trumpet-tongued
against the deep damnation of his taking off,"&mdash;severally
exhibit, in the most pre-eminent degree,
all those mighty elements which constitute the perfection
of tragic art&mdash;the grand, the pitiful, and the
terrible. <i>Hamlet</i> is a history of mind&mdash;a tragedy of
thought. It contains the deepest philosophy, and
most profound wisdom; yet speaks the language of
the heart, touching the secret spring of every sense
and feeling. Here we have no ideal exaltation of
character, but life with its blended faults ands,&mdash;a gentle nature unstrung by passing events,
and thus rendered "out of tune and harsh."</p>

<p>The original story of Hamlet is to be found in
the Latin pages of the Danish historian, Saxo Grammaticus,
who died in the year 1208. Towards the
end of the sixteenth century, the French author,
Francis de Belleforest, introduced the fable into a
collection of novels, which were translated into
English, and printed in a small quarto black letter
volume, under the title of the "Historie of Hamblett,"
from which source Shakespeare constructed the
present tragedy.</p>

<p>Saxo has placed his history about 200 years before
Christianity, when barbarians, clothed in skins, peopled
the shores of the Baltic. The poet, however, has so
far modernised the subject as to make Hamlet a
Christian, and England tributary to the "sovereign
majesty of Denmark." A date can therefore be
easily fixed, and the costume of the tenth and
eleventh centuries may be selected for the purpose.
There are but few authentic records in existence, but
these few afford reason to believe that very slight
difference existed between the dress of the Dane and
that of the Anglo-Saxon of the same period.</p>

<p>Since its first representation, upwards of two
centuries and a half ago, no play has been acted so
frequently, or commanded such universal admiration.
It draws within the sphere of its attraction both the
scholastic and the unlearned. It finds a response in
every breast, however high or however humble.
By its colossal aid it exalts the drama of England
above that of every nation, past or present. It is,
indeed, the most marvellous creation of human
intellect.</p>

<i>A little more than kin, and less than kind.</i>] Dr. Johnson says
that <i>kind</i> is the Teutonic word for <i>child</i>. Hamlet, therefore, answers
to the titles of <i>cousin</i> and <i>son</i>, which the king had given him, that he
was somewhat more than <i>cousin</i>, and less than <i>son</i>. Steevens remarks,
that it seems to have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we
are in blood, the further we must be from love; the greater the
<i>kindred</i> is, the less the <i>kindness</i> must be." <i>Kin</i> is still used in the
Midland Counties for <i>cousin</i>, and <i>kind</i> signifies <i>nature</i>. Hamlet may,
therefore, mean that the relationship between them had become

cunning.<a class="tag" name="tagII_60" id="tagII_60" href="#noteII_60">60</a> One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas &#198;neas'

<i>Polonius,</i>] Doctor Johnson describes Polonius as "a man bred in
courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his
knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. A man
positive and confident, because he knows his mind was once strong,
and knows not that it is become weak." The idea of dotage encroaching
upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of
Polonius.</p>

<p><i>This must be known; which being kept close, might move</i></p>
<p><i>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, this must be
made known to the king, for (being kept secret) the hiding Hamlet's
love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen, than
the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from
Hamlet.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Shakespeare's age, to conclude acts and scenes
with a couplet, a custom which was continued for nearly a century
afterwards.</p>

<i>You are a fishmonger.</i>] This was an expression better understood
in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no doubt was relished by
the audience of the Globe Theatre as applicable to the Papists, who in
Queen Elizabeth's time were esteemed enemies to the Government.
Hence the proverbial phrase of <i>He's an honest man and eats no fish;</i>
to signify he's a friend to the Government and a Protestant.</p>

<i>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing
carrion,&mdash;&mdash;Have you a daughter?</i>] <i>i.e.</i>, Hamlet having just remarked
that honesty is very rare in the world, adds, that since there
is so little virtue, since corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots
are <i>bred</i> by the sun, which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius
ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun,
lest she should prove <i>"a breeder of sinners;"</i> for though <i>conception</i>
(understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might chance
to <i>conceive</i> (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity. Hamlet's abrupt
question, <i>"Have you a daughter?"</i> is evidently intended to impress
Polonius with the belief of the Prince's madness.&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Malone.</span></p>

<i>To know a hawk from a hernshaw</i> is an ancient proverb, sometimes
corrupted into <i>handsaw</i>. Spencer quotes the proverb, as meaning, <i>wise

<i>The first row of the pious Chanson</i>] This expression does not
appear to be very well understood. Steevens tells us that the <i>pious

history thrown into loose rhymes, and sung about the streets. The <i>first

<i>By the altitude of a chopine.</i>] A chioppine is a high shoe, or
rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was more famous for them
than any other place. They are described as having been made of
wood covered with coloured leather, and sometimes <i>even half a yard
high</i>, their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that
they could not walk without being supported.</p>

<i>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</i>] <i>A sea of troubles</i>
among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage; so that the expression
figuratively means, the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us,
and encompass us round like a sea.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_10" id="noteIII_10" href="#tagIII_10">III.10</a>

<i>No traveller returns,</i>] The traveller whom Hamlet had seen, though
he appeared in the same habit which he had worn in his life-time, was
nothing but a shadow, "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently,
<i>incorporeal</i>. The Ghost has given us no account of the region from
whence he came, being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the
secrets of his prison-house."&mdash;<span class="charname">Malone.</span></p>

<p><a name="noteIII_20" id="noteIII_20" href="#tagIII_20">III.20</a>

<p><a name="noteIII_22" id="noteIII_22" href="#tagIII_22">III.22</a></p>
<p><i>With this regard, their currents turn away,</i><br />
<i>And lose the name of action.</i>]</p>
<p>From this sole consideration have
their drifts diverted, and lose the character and name of enterprise.</p>

<i>If you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse
to your beauty.</i>]  <i>i.e.</i>, if you really possess these qualities, chastity
and beauty, and mean to support the character of both, your
honesty should be so chary of your beauty, as not to suffer a thing so
fragile to entertain discourse, or to be parleyed with.</p>

<p>The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn best
suited to her purpose.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_26" id="noteIII_26" href="#tagIII_26">III.26</a>

the personal for the neutral pronoun.</p>

<i>Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:</i>] So change the
original constitution and properties, as that no smack of them shall
remain. "Inoculate our stock" are terms in gardening.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_30" id="noteIII_30" href="#tagIII_30">III.30</a>

seem, in the time of Shakespeare, to have been general objects of

<i>Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:</i>]

<i>You jig, you amble, and you lisp,</i>] This is an allusion to the
manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the spirit of his contemporaries,
means here to satirise.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_33" id="noteIII_33" href="#tagIII_33">III.33</a>
<i>Make your wantonness your ignorance.</i>] You mistake by <i>wanton</i>
affectation, and pretend to mistake by <i>ignorance</i>.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_34" id="noteIII_34" href="#tagIII_34">III.34</a>
<i>All but one shall live;</i>] <i>One</i> is the king.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_35" id="noteIII_35" href="#tagIII_35">III.35</a>
<i>To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.</i>] There is no doubt that
Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere, but he treats her
with apparent severity because he is aware that Ophelia has been purposely
thrown in his way; that spies are about them; and that it is
necessary for the preservation of his life, to assume a conduct which he
thought would be attributed to madness only.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_36" id="noteIII_36" href="#tagIII_36">III.36</a>

<i>Thus;</i>] <i>i.e.</i>, thrown out thus.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_44" id="noteIII_44" href="#tagIII_44">III.44</a>
<i>Robustious perrywig-pated fellow</i>] This is a ridicule on the quantity
of false hair worn in Shakespeare's time, for wigs were not in
common use till the reign of Charles the Second. <i>Robustious</i> means
making an extravagant show of passion.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_45" id="noteIII_45" href="#tagIII_45">III.45</a>

<p><a name="noteIII_46" id="noteIII_46" href="#tagIII_46">III.46</a>
<i>O'er-doing Termagant;</i>] The Crusaders, and those who celebrated
them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and supposed Mahomet, or
Mahound, to be one of their deities, and Tervagant or Termagant,
another. This imaginary personage was introduced into our old plays
and moralities, and represented as of a most violent character, so that
a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. The word is
now used for a scolding woman.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_47" id="noteIII_47" href="#tagIII_47">III.47</a>
<i>It out-herods Herod:</i>] In all the old moralities and mysteries this
personage was always represented as a tyrant of a very violent temper,
using the most exaggerated language. Hence the expression.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_48" id="noteIII_48" href="#tagIII_48">III.48</a>
<i>The very age and body of the time its form and pressure.</i>] <i>i.e.</i>,

<p><a name="noteIII_51" id="noteIII_51" href="#tagIII_51">III.51</a>
<i>Your allowance,</i>] In your approbation.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_52" id="noteIII_52" href="#tagIII_52">III.52</a>
<i>Not to speak it profanely,</i>] <i>i.e.</i>, <i>irreverently</i>, in allusion to Hamlet's
supposition that God had not made such men, but that they were
only the handy work of God's assistants.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_53" id="noteIII_53" href="#tagIII_53">III.53</a>
<i>Indifferently</i>] In a reasonable degree.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_54" id="noteIII_54" href="#tagIII_54">III.54</a>
<i>Speak no more them is set down for them:</i>] Shakespeare alludes
to a custom of his time, when the clown, or low comedian, as he would
now be called, addressing the audience during the play, entered into a
contest of raillery and sarcasm with such spectators as chose to engage
with him.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_55" id="noteIII_55" href="#tagIII_55">III.55</a>
<i>Barren spectators</i>] <i>i.e.</i>, dull, unapprehensive spectators.</p>

where <i>thrift</i>, that is, thriving, or emolument may follow sycophancy.</p>

interest.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_60" id="noteIII_60" href="#tagIII_60">III.60</a>
<i>Whose blood and judgment</i>] Dr. Johnson says that according to
the doctrine of the four humours, <i>desire</i> and <i>confidence</i> were seated in
the blood, and judgment in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the
humours made a perfect character.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_61" id="noteIII_61" href="#tagIII_61">III.61</a>
<i>The very comment of thy soul</i>] The most intense direction of every

develope itself.</p>


<p><a name="noteIII_63" id="noteIII_63" href="#tagIII_63">III.63</a>

anvil.</p>

he shall put on.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_65" id="noteIII_65" href="#tagIII_65">III.65</a>
<i>I have nothing with this answer; these words are not mine.</i>] <i>i.e.</i>,
they grow not out of mine: have no relation to anything said by me.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_66" id="noteIII_66" href="#tagIII_66">III.66</a>
<i>No, nor mine, now.</i>] They are now anybody's. Dr. Johnson
observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than
while he keeps them unspoken."</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_67" id="noteIII_67" href="#tagIII_67">III.67</a>
<i>You played once in the university, you say?</i>] The practice of
acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very
ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_68" id="noteIII_68" href="#tagIII_68">III.68</a>
<i>I did enact Julius C&#230;sar:</i>] A Latin play on the subject of
C&#230;sar's death, was performed at Christ-church, Oxford, in 1582.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_70" id="noteIII_70" href="#tagIII_70">III.70</a>
<i>Lying down at Ophelia's feet.</i>] To lie at the feet of a mistress
during any dramatic representation, seems to have been a common act
of gallantry.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_71" id="noteIII_71" href="#tagIII_71">III.71</a>
<i>Jig-maker,</i>] Writer of ludicrous interludes. <i>A jig</i> was not in
Shakespeare's time only a dance, but a ludicrous dialogue in metre;
many historical ballads were also called <i>jigs</i>.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_72" id="noteIII_72" href="#tagIII_72">III.72</a>
<i>For I'll have a suit of sables.</i>] Wherever his scene might be, the
customs of his country were ever in Shakespeare's thoughts. A suit
trimmed with sables was in our author's own time the richest dress
worn by men in England. By the Statute of Apparel, 24 Henry VIII.,
c. 13, (<i>article furres</i>), it is ordained, that none under the degree of an
<i>Earl</i> may use <i>sables</i>.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_73" id="noteIII_73" href="#tagIII_73">III.73</a>
<i>He must build churches, then.</i>] Such benefactors to society were
sure to be recorded by means of the feast day on which the patron saints
and founders of churches were commemorated in every parish. This
custom has long since ceased.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_74" id="noteIII_74" href="#tagIII_74">III.74</a>
<i>Miching mallecho;</i>] To <i>mich</i> is a provincial word, signifying <i>to
lie hid</i>, or <i>to skulk</i>, or <i>act by stealth</i>. It was probably once generally
used. Mallecho is supposed to be corrupted from the Spanish <i>Malechor</i>,
which means a poisoner.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_75" id="noteIII_75" href="#tagIII_75">III.75</a>
<i>The posy of a ring?</i>] Such poetry as you may find engraven on a
ring.</p>

<i>You are as good as a chorus,</i>] The persons who are supposed to
behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy, and sing their sentiments
between the acts.</p>

<p>The use to which Shakespeare converted the chorus, may be seen in
King Henry V.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_87" id="noteIII_87" href="#tagIII_87">III.87</a>
<i>I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the
puppets dallying.</i>] This refers to the interpreter, who formerly sat on
the stage at all <i>puppet shows</i>, and explained to the audience. <i>The puppets
dallying</i> are here made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's
bosom.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_88" id="noteIII_88" href="#tagIII_88">III.88</a></p>
<div class="poem">
<p><i>The croaking raven</i></p>
<p><i>Doth bellow for revenge.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, begin without more delay; for the
raven, foreknowing the deed, is already croaking, and, as it were,
calling out for the revenge which will ensue.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_89" id="noteIII_89" href="#tagIII_89">III.89</a>
<i>Midnight weeds</i>] The force of the epithet <i>midnight</i>, will be best
displayed by a corresponding passage in Macbeth:</p>

<p><i>1st Clo.</i> (<span class="smallroman">R.</span>) Is she to be buried in christian burial

<p><i>1st Clo.</i> How can that be, unless she drowned herself
in her own defence?</p>

<p><i>2nd Clo.</i> Why, 'tis found so.</p>

<p><i>1st Clo.</i> It must be <i>se offendendo</i>;<a class="tag" name="tagV_4" id="tagV_4" href="#noteV_4">4</a> it cannot be else.
For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it
argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to
act, to do, and to perform:<a class="tag" name="tagV_5" id="tagV_5" href="#noteV_5">5</a> argal,<a class="tag" name="tagV_6" id="tagV_6" href="#noteV_6">6</a> she drowned herself

you that; but if the water come to him and drown him,
he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of
his own death shortens not his own life.</p>

<p><i>2nd Clo.</i> But is this law?</p>

<p><i>1st Clo.</i> Ay, marry is't; crowner's-quest law.<a class="tag" name="tagV_9" id="tagV_9" href="#noteV_9">9</a></p>

<p><i>2nd Clo.</i> Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not
been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of
christian burial.</p>

<p><i>1st Clo.</i> Why, there thou say'st:<a class="tag" name="tagV_10" id="tagV_10" href="#noteV_10">10</a> And the more pity

drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.<a class="tag" name="tagV_11" id="tagV_11" href="#noteV_11">11</a>

does well; But how does it well? it does well to those
that do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built
stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well
to thee. To't again, come.</p>

<i>If the man go to this water,&mdash;it is, will he, nill he, he goes,</i>]
Still floundering and confounding himself. He means to represent it
as a <i>wilful</i> act, and of course without any mixture of <i>nill</i> or nolens in
it. Had he gone, as stated, whether he <i>would or not</i>, it would not
have been of his own accord, or his act.</p>

Howard, Earl of Surrey, who was beheaded in 1547. The song is to
be found in Dr. Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i>.</p>

<i>But to play at loggats with them?</i>] A <i>loggat</i> is a small <i>log</i>, or
piece of wood; a diminutive from <i>log</i>. Hence <i>loggats</i>, as the name of
an old game among the common people, and one of those forbidden by
a statute of the 33rd of Henry VIII. A stake was fixed into the ground,
and those who played threw <i>loggats</i> at it.</p>

<i>This grave shall have a living monument:</i>] There is an ambiguity

<i>Very sultry and hot,</i>] Hamlet is here playing over the same farce
with Osric which he had formerly done with Polonius. The idea of
this scene is evidently suggested by Juvenal.</p>

<p><a name="noteV_52" id="noteV_52" href="#tagV_52">V.52</a>
<i>For mine ease, in good faith.</i>] From contemporary authors this

would desire to <i>contemplate</i> for imitation.</p>

<p><a name="noteV_57" id="noteV_57" href="#tagV_57">V.57</a>
<i>What imports the nomination, &amp;c.</i>] What is the object of the introduction
of this gentleman's name?</p>

<p><a name="noteV_58" id="noteV_58" href="#tagV_58">V.58</a>
<i>I dare not&mdash;lest I should compare&mdash;were to know himself.</i>] No
one can have a perfect conception of the measure of another's excellence,
unless he shall himself come up to that standard. Dr. Johnson says, I
dare not pretend to know him, lest I should pretend to an equality: no
man can completely know another, but by knowing himself, which is the
utmost extent of human wisdom.</p>
